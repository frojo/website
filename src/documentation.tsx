    <h1> sou.ls </h1>
    <p> in March 2020, when the pandemic first hit, I (like most) felt pretty lonely and instead of working through it in a healthy way, I made <A href="https://sou.ls">sou.ls</A></p>
    <p>At around the same time, I started spending a lot of time on Instagram. Social media always seemed scary and not worth it, but suddenly that's how I was maintaining relationships with my friends. I knew that, big-picture, me and my friendships were <A href="http://wagesforfacebook.com/">being exploited</A>. But still, it's nice to see a friend napping with their cat, or taking a huge rip from a bong, or sharing a good COVID meme.</p>
      <p>I mostly spent time in the messages tab, though I didn't really DM people much. i found myself looking at the profile pics of my friends, and noticing when last they'd been "active". When it said "Active Now" next to their portrait with the little green dot, I'd wonder if, like me, laying belly-down on their bed. Maybe they were under a tree. Was the sun still up in their timezone? their virtual presence there was a source of comfort, proof that they existed, that i existed.</p>
    <p>at the same time, it's troubling that i have this way of monitoring the activity of my friends, and with such granularity. not only do i know when someone is currently online, i can tell if they were online just 2 minutes ago, or if they haven't been online since yesterday. like a lot of Instagram's design, this normalized mutual mass surveillance doesn't seem healthy for anybody involved.</p>

I wanted to introduce PICO-8 to the Processing community and explore if there was anything we could learn from its limitations-celebrating design.</p>
